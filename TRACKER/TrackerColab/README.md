## Offline Tracker for HexMaze experiments

In this repository you can find two notebooks: 
1. Tracker-Colab.ipynb to run the tracker. The requirements to run the tracker, steps to run it and troubleshooting infos can be found in this notebook.  
2. TrackerColab_Yolo_Training_and_Tracking.ipynb with all the necessary steps needed to train a neural network model (Yolo version 3) using the Darknet framework.  


The script of the tracker can be found in TrackerYolov3-Colab.py. To run it from the command prompt follow the instruction at the beginning of the script and uncomment some lines.
Before running the script in AnacondaPrompt(python 3.6+) install onxxruntime-gpu (pip install onnxruntime-gpu) and opencv (pip install opencv-python).
